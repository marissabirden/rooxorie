Внимание! Это старый проект. Смотрите Веб-сайт текущего проекта здесь.  In computer science, constraint programming is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints.Constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found. 
The answers to those questions began to emerge thanks to an article in the August 8, 2017 issue of the Nation. By no means a pro-Trump publication, the Nation published an exhaustive report about an exacting forensic investigation of the DNC hack by the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), an organization of former CIA, FBI, National Security Agency, and military intelligence officers, technical experts, and analysts. As reported by the Nation, VIPS has a well-established recor.
